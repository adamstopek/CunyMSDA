Week 10 Assignment:

Implement a map-reduce solution to determine total population by state. 
You may submit your code as a text file

This is the map function which maps state and population 

var mapFunction = function() {
                       emit(this.state, this.pop);
                   };	

This is the reduce function which sums up population values for each state
				   
var reduceFunction = function(keyState, valuesPop) {
                          return Array.sum(valuesPop);
                      };

Now we implement the functions and output the results to a new collection
					  
db.zipcodes.mapReduce(
                     mapFunction,
                     reduceFunction,
                     { out: "state_populations" }
                   );
