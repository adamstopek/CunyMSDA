IS 607 Week 5 Quiz -- Adam Stopek

Reading Quiz: "Tidy Data"
Question 1:
Data "tidying" is what Hadley Wickham calls structuring datasets to facilitate analysis.

Question 2:
Three properties in tidy data are:
Each observation is a row
Each column is a variable
Each observation unit forms a table

Question 3:
The five most common problems with messy datasets are:
Column headers are values and not variable names
One column contains multiple variables
Variables are stored in both columns and rows
The same table is used to store different types of observations units
A single observational unit is stored across multiple tables

Question 4:
Define the following:
Filter: Filtering is the act of subsetting the data or selecting specific observations that meet a specific condition.
Transform: Transforming the data is the act of modifying or adding a variable. An example of this is performing a log transformation to the data, or adding up to column together to form a new variable
Aggregate: Aggregating the data is the act of collapsing multiple values into a single value. An example of this is summing up a variable or averaging it.
Sort: Sorting the data is the act of changing the order of it. For example sorting a variable in descending order.

Question 5:
The function in base R for filtering data is subset()


Reading Quiz: "Introduction to dplyr"

Question 1:
Advantages/Disadvantages to using dply over plyr package:
Advantages: Much faster, Better joins, smarter printing
Disadvantages: Can only be used with data frames

Question 2:
Advantages/Disadvantages to using plyr over base function:
Advantages: Joining is easier, aggregate functions, less verbose 
Disadvantages: Base functions work well with vectors

Reading Quiz: "tidyr"
Question 1:
What are the two functions in the tidyr package that correspond to spreadsheet functions pivot and unpivot?
gather() corresponds to pivtoing data
spread() corresponds to unpivoting data
